## How It's Made:
**Languages, frameworks and tools used: MongoDB, React, Node js, Express, Redux Toolkit and Figma**

The aim of this project was to replicate an e-commerce website as closely as possible, using my current skillset. I wanted to put my abilities to the
test and create a full-stack application using the MERN stack, which I have been building with for the last few months.

Main goals:
- create a beautiful, fast and responsive UI with React
- practice building and thinking in React
- create a functional application, where a user can browse products and checkout their cart
- practice back-end skills and build an API to use with the front-end

This project started with wireframing out each page, creating the designs in Figma and laying out/styling the UI. Once I was mostly happy with the way the
design looked, I started to map out the functionality for each page such as state and routing. I approached this project mostly page by page in terms of
thinking through the functionality/logic, which caused me more work in the long run and meant I was passing around state more than I would have liked. I 
decided to implement Redux towards the end of the project, which made things a lot easier but was also a learning curve to understand and implement.
